Gimmie Chocolate is a 2D platform game created with Unity and C#. It is loosely inspired by the super mario bros series.
The game adventure begins when a little girl who loves chocolate and sweets, is transported into a candy-themed world. Using simple controls the player must navigate through the levels, collecting chocolates and gummy bears along the way. Honey bee enemies line the little girl’s pathway across the game world and must be avoided. Getting stung by a bee will cause death. Obtaining as many collectibles as possible and reaching the finish line with the highest score, is the aim of the game.


## Requirements
The following software needs to be installed to open the project.
- Unity 2021.3.12f1 
- Unity Hub
- Git

## Project Installation
Clone a copy of this repository in your chosen destination directory. The following git command can be used:
`git clone git@github.com:alexandrac77/psychic-pancake.git`

- Open the unity project within the unity editor
- Open the Unity Hub 
- Add the clone directory and open it
- Once Unity opens the project, press play to experience the game.

## Troubleshooting
If errors in the project that are related to Mirror networking occur, delete the Mirror package from the assets of the project. The ‘multiplayer’ folder, located within the scripts folder will also need to be deleted. The scene named 'Multiplayer' will need to be deleted. This should fix any Mirror-related issues. 
Although Mirror networking has been removed from the project, some deleted assets re-appeared within the project for the developer. Therefore this point has been included, in the case that it happens for others who want to download this project.

## Game Details
### Player
The protagonist of the game is a little girl who enjoys eating sweets. The player can explore the game as this character by using the left & right arrow keys. The space key can be used to jump.

### Enemies
Honey bee enemies are scattered throughout the levels. Some are stationary, while others move in pre-defined paths. The enemies need to be avoided. If stung by a bee, the player dies and the level restarts. The player’s score will reset to 0 if they die.

### Collectibles
Chocolate & gummy bears are available for collection. They are worth 1 point each. The player needs to collect as many as they can to achieve the highest score. As the levels in the game increase, the collectibles will become harder to obtain. Collectibles are easily noticeable as pink or yellow sparkles surround them.

### Levels
Levels in the game can be distinguished by a change in background music. Each level differs in appearance and features a new candy-themed design. One secret level exists and can be accessed by travelling through a pipe that is located in level 2. The secret level provides the chance to collect a large amount of chocolate & gummy bears without the risk of being stung by bees. The levels provide a new environment and obstacles to challenge the player.
Saving the Game
A player can quit and re-load the game from their last position in-game. A loaded game can be accessed through the start menu.
